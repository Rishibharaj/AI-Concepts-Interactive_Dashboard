# AI Concepts Dashboard

An interactive visualization of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** concepts, organized into hierarchical categories. Built with **Plotly** and **HTML**, this dashboard helps learners and professionals explore:

- **Core AI/ML Concepts**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model architectures (CNN, RNN, Transformer), training techniques, evaluation metrics.
- **Advanced AI Topics**: GANs, Diffusion Models, Graph Neural Networks, LLMs (Prompt Engineering, RAG), Responsible AI, Federated Learning, Edge AI.

## Features
- 🎯 Dynamic **Sunburst Chart** visualization
- 🔘 **Radio button toggle** between Core and Advanced concepts
- 🌐 Fully interactive and browser-based

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `AI_Concepts_Sunburst_Interactive.html` in any modern browser.
3. Use the radio buttons to switch between Core and Advanced AI concepts.
4. Explore the hierarchy interactively.
